**Log journal for documentation of slot machine game** 

**Nov 27 2025**
Today:
Initial commit. Added necessary files to create window using OpenGL. 

TODO:
session I should add necessary files and set up a plan for project.

**Dec 4 2025**
Today:
Added sub/folders and clear instructions on how the project should proceed.
Starting with data objects, a reel as an example, simulate a reel
The mathematical models are written in python using their math libs.

TODO:
Add serialization/parsing hooks: static ReelStrip fromConfig(const ReelStripConfig&)  or a free helper that reads assets/reels/*.json into the vector.
Optional weighting support: if you plan on virtual stops, add a parallel weight array (std::vector<double> weights_) and methods to normalise/sample by weight.

**Dec 5 2025**
Today:
Done with reelstrip structs, helper methods etc.
Should do some basic tests with probability models

**Dec 7 2025**
Today:
Started with probability model using Monte Carlo simulation
Still need to have it read the values from cpp to python

**Jan 19 2026**
Today:
Starting with indexing, wrapping and spin state of reels
Added a Reel wrapper around ReelStrip that keeps the strip immutable while tracking a stop index.
Implemented spin using a shared std::mt19937, plus accessors for current/above/below symbols and a fixed trio via visibleSymbols.
Exposed setStop for deterministic tests, clarifying how future Monte Carlo simulations will reuse the same RNG flow

TODO:
build a minimal spin evaluator that owns several Reels, runs one spin with a fixed RNG seed, 
and totals payouts for a sample payline to unit-test full spin flow.

**February 19th 2026**
Today:
- Refactor: comments, improved readability
- Refactor: `reel_strip.h` now only implements class, fields and method structure. `reel_strip.cpp` implements the functions of the header.
- Added: `spin_evaluation.h` and `spin_evaluation.cpp` to handle the payout logic. 
- Testing: Simulated random spins with weighted probability to CLI

TODO:
- Simulate the spins on a higher scale, using matplotlib python, to identift current RTP and improve
- Graphics for the slot machine
