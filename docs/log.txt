Initial commit. Added necessary files to create window using OpenGL. 
# Next session I should add necessary files and set up a plan for project.

Dec 4 2025
Added sub/folders and clear instructions on how the project should proceed.
Starting with data objects, a reel as an example, simulate a reel
The mathematical models are written in python using their math libs.
# Add serialization/parsing hooks: static ReelStrip fromConfig(const ReelStripConfig&) 
# or a free helper that reads assets/reels/*.json into the vector.
# Optional weighting support: if you plan on virtual stops, add a parallel weight array 
# (std::vector<double> weights_) and methods to normalise/sample by weight.

Done with reelstrip structs, helper methods etc.
Should do some basic tests with probability models

Dec 7 2025
Started with probability model using Monte Carlo simulation
Still need to have it read the values from cpp to python

Jan 19 2026
Starting with indexing, wrapping and spin state of reels
Added a Reel wrapper around ReelStrip that keeps the strip immutable while tracking a stop index.
Implemented spin using a shared std::mt19937, plus accessors for current/above/below symbols and a fixed trio via visibleSymbols.
Exposed setStop for deterministic tests, clarifying how future Monte Carlo simulations will reuse the same RNG flow
Next is to build a minimal spin evaluator that owns several Reels, runs one spin with a fixed RNG seed, 
and totals payouts for a sample payline to unit-test full spin flow.
