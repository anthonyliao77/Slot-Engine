Added sub/folders and clear instructions on how the project should proceed.
Starting with data objects, a reel as an example, simulate a reel
The mathematical models are written in python using their math libs.
# Add serialization/parsing hooks: static ReelStrip fromConfig(const ReelStripConfig&) 
# or a free helper that reads assets/reels/*.json into the vector.
# Optional weighting support: if you plan on virtual stops, add a parallel weight array 
# (std::vector<double> weights_) and methods to normalise/sample by weight.
