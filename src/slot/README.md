# src/slot

Host the mathematical model of the slot machine:
- reel layouts and strip weights
- RNG wrappers and spin simulation logic
- payout evaluation, bonuses, and state machines
- analytical tools for RTP, volatility, and compliance checks

Statistical formulas	Python	libraries + simplicity
Probability simulation	Python	extremely fast with NumPy
UI + OpenGL rendering	C++	speed and real-time graphics
Real time RNG	C++	deterministic speed
Math prototyping	Python	rapid iteration
Final embedded game logic	C++	performance
